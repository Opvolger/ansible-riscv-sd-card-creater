Description: Disable Broadcom PCI driver
 The Broadcom PCI driver seems to break u-boot when booting on a Pi 4B with
 8Gb of RAM, when no monitor is attached. This is a brute-force and ignorance
 patch and further (upstream) investigation is warranted to discover why this
 is the case. Commit 3113c84ba25ec3ceae072cc5ad450c4238425939 (a merge,
 annoyingly) is the first bad commit in the u-boot repository when bisecting
 this issue.
